# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or bug in my project, please report it by emailing me at [reno.mardiputra@gmail.com](mailto:reno.mardiputra@gmail.com). I ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until I have had a chance to address it.

### Response Time

- I will aim to acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
- You will receive updates as I investigate and resolve the issue.

### Handling Vulnerabilities

- Once a vulnerability or bug is reported, I will investigate it promptly.
- If the issue is confirmed, I will work on a fix and release an update as soon as possible.
- If the report is declined, I will inform you with an explanation.
- You may choose to be credited for your report in a security advisory, or remain anonymous if you prefer.

## Supported Versions

Currently, there is no specific security support in place for this project. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a landing page, and Bootstrap v5.3.3 for styling. Please note that security updates for the Bootstrap framework itself are handled by its maintainers.

## Security Patch Policy

At this time, I do not have a formal security patch policy. Any necessary updates or patches will be issued on a case-by-case basis as vulnerabilities or bugs are reported and confirmed.
